# Week 1: Variables and Operators

Learning Objectives
1. Show them the python interpreter
2. Get them comfortable with the interpreter
    a. Show them `control + C` and `control  + D`
3. Get them comfortable with floats, integers, booleans, and strings

### Variables

The fundamental building block of all programming languages is the *variable*. **A _variable_ is a word that stores a value.** Here are some examples of some variables and how they are used:

```python
x = 5
y = 4

z = x + y
```

Here, `x`, `y`, and `z` are all examples of variables.

There are four fundamental variable types in Python:

1. Integer
2. Float
3. String
4. Boolean

We will get into the definitions of these words below.

##### Integers

An _integer_ is a whole number...

```python
numPatients = 5
count = 0
```

##### Floats

A float a number that has decimal values...

They are initialized like integers, except with the addition of the decimal point and numbers that follow.

```python
volumeLevel = 0.93
totalScore = 100.0
```

##### Strings

Strings are _strings_ of characters of any kind. Look at the following examples:

```python
sentence1 = 'cs106r is awesome!'
emailDomain = '@gmail.com'
jerseyNumber = '9'
```

Here, `sentence1`, `emailDomain`, and `jerseyNumber` are all examples of Strings. Notice that a number can be a string.

##### Boolean

Booleans are variables that represent True or False values.

_Why not use strings that say "True" or "False" instead?_

We use booleans because they take up less space in the computer. Instead of storing a string of characters, we can store a 0 for a False value, and a 1 for a True value.

```python
isGirl = True
isBoy = False
```

Now that we have gone through the different variables, let us talk about the operators...

### Operators

##### Arithmetic Operators

1. `**`
2. `*` or `/`
3. `+` or `-`

##### Boolean Operators

- `==`
- `!=`
- `>`
- `>=`
- `<`
- `<=`

### Python Interpreter

`$ python3`

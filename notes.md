## Introduction
Hello! Welcome to the course notes for CS 106R. On this page, you'll find all of the material we'll cover in the class. We designed these course notes to be as lightweight as possible â€“ in other words, they will cover all the essentials but won't dive into material too deeply. Throughout you will find links to external resources we've found helpful in understanding concepts.

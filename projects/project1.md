# Introduction 
_Welcome to Project 1!_ 

PyBot is a simple robot. She lives in the sparse planes of PyCountry where the peaches grow. In this project, we'll program PyBot to explore her world, harvest fruit and build cities.

We discussed PyBot and PyCountry in the [class notes](cs106r/notes#boolean) and you should refer to them throughout this project. That being said we'll provide a short overview of how PyBot works here. 

PyBot is a virtual robot that can be programmed in Python using a few simple functions that PyBot was built to understand. There are two kinds of PyBot functinos: _commands_ and _conditions_. 

**Commands** tell PyBot to take a specific action like move forward (i.e. `move()`), rotate 90 degrees to the right (i.e. `turn_right()`), or pick up a fruit (i.e. `pick_fruit()`). 

**Conditions** ask PyBot simple yes or no questions like "Is the front clear?" (i.e. `is_front_clear()`) or "Is their a fruit on this square?" (i.e. `has_fruit()`). Conditions can be placed in `if` statements and `while` loops to control the flow of your program. 

To see the full set of functions that PyBot understands see the course notes [here](cs106r/notes). 

Throughout these assignments, it is **very important** that you define your own functions and decompose your code. For a reminder on how to define your own functions see the course notes [here](cs106r/notes). 

This project has 3 parts. You can work on the three parts below, or open them in a new window by clicking on "open in Repl.it". Specific instructions for each assignment can be found in the repl.it windows.
